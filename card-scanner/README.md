# Digimon Card Game (2020) Card Scanner

This directory hosts the client-side browser code to scan [Digimon Card Game (2020)](https://world.digimoncard.com) cards via a webcam and match them using pre-calculated perceptual hashes from the [db](../db).

The primary goal is to be small and fast. As a consequence some cards do not match well. Particularly cards that have reflective or other foils are problematic.

This is currently just a small proof-of-concept. Accuracy, UX, and offline improvements are all planned for future releases.
